### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, 

My name is Jaden Alberding. I am a thrid year software engineering student currently enrolled at the University of Victoria.

## Background

I grew up in Calgary, Alberta. Thoughout my childhood I became very intersted in the ocean and video games. These dreams of living by the ocean and following a career with computers came true when I got accepted to the University of Victoria to become a engineer. This lifestyle change allowed to me to become the person I wanted to be. 

## Acedemics

My first year of University was very busy. Maintianing a work-life balance was the only way I was able to get through the first year. I took up weightlifting, made new friends and made the time to visit the ocean whenever I had the chance. The first year is also where I picked up coding and decided to specialize and become a software engineer.

## Projects

Throughout the next few years I would have ideas of projects I wanted to start:

- Terminal BlackJack using C :spades:
  _ First github personal project
  _ Created Visuals in C by making my own ASCII art for the cards
  _ Developed the logic based on previous knowledge of the game
  _ Began developing a backend datatbase to save credit data for each player (Still in progress)

- Personal Website using HTML and CSS :open_file_folder: 
  _ Began developing a website using HTML and CSS
  _ Future ideas were to integrate 3d models and visual effects using JS

- Battle Snake using Python :snake:
  _ Participated in a Hackathon hosted by the University of Victoria
  _ Exposed to Python and REST API's to create a autonomous snake player following the game logic of Snake
  - Placed 3rd in Semifinals 

- P.L.A.I.T.U.S using Python :robot:
  _ Most abbitious project to date
  _ Began creating a neural network without using libraries to be able to day trade stocks
  _ Goals of the project:
    _ [X] Complete Neural Network
    _ [ ] Impliment reward system
    _ [X] Create a simultaion
    _ [ ] Train model on simulated data
    _ [ ] Use API's to recieve real time data
    _ [ ] Test trained model on real data
    _ [ ] Create a front end for the AI
    _ [ ] Link AI with a trading Broker and test with small account

- More to come...
