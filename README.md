### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, 

My name is Jaden Alberding. I am a thrid year software engineering student currently enrolled at the University of Victoria.

## Background

I grew up in Calgary, Alberta and thoughout my childhood I became very intersted in the ocean and video games. These dreams of living by the ocean and following a career with computers came true when I got accepted to the University of Victoria to become a engineer. This lifestyle change allowed to me to become the person I wanted to be. 

## Academics

My first year of university was very busy. Maintianing a work-life balance was the only way I was able to get through the first year. I took up weightlifting, made new friends and made the time to visit the ocean whenever I had the chance. The first year is also where I picked up coding and decided to specialize and become a software engineer.

## Hobbies

While Github is a place for code I would also like to share some of my other passions as well. I strongly believe that a balance between technology and the outdoors is neccessary for a fufilling and happy life. Some of my hobbies are as follows:

- Snowboarding
- Car Mechanics (Modifying, Fixing etc)
- Fishing
- Hiking
- Weightlifting
- Gaming
- Photography
- 3D modeling

## Projects

The following are my current and past projects I am working on:
